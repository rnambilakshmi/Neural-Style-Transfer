## Introduction
Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take three images, a content image, a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and the input image you want to style — and blend them together such that the input image is transformed to look like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style image

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository 
2. In the same directory save the content and style images of interest 
3. Correspondingly change style_pic and content_pic in the notebook
